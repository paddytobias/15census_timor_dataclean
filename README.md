# Data Processing R scriptlets for 2015 Timor-Leste Census data

*I am still refining these scripts for others to repeat my work.* 


The objective is to get the Excel data, published by the [General Directorate of Statistics](http://www.statistics.gov.tl/category/publications/census-publications/2015-census-publications/), into a state so that analysis can be conducted programmatically across all ~700 worksheets. 

The [Data folder](https://github.com/paddytobias/15census_timor_dataclean/tree/master/data) holds all 45 Excel workbooks as well as a pdf of the Preliminary Report of the 2015 Population and Housing Census.

The [Scripts folder](https://github.com/paddytobias/15census_timor_dataclean/tree/master/data) holds all of the scripts I have been writing to process this data out of .xls format, into .csv format, and then into a state that uses the table names and removes any redundant data-table features (e.g., all empty rows, two headings, etc.)
